        Hello everyone! My name is Andrei-Daniel Dumitru and i want to share my
        passion with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        First of all, I am a student in Bucharest, Romania, I'm 20 years old and
        this love for cars developed from a young age, being surrounded and also
        guided by people that have the same passion. I'm talking about my dad
        who is also a car lover and my grandfather who was a mechanic. Since I
        was like 5-6 years old I started to visit him at the garage and I
        immediatly fell in love with cars. Since my first car was a Mini Cooper
        I've decided to make this site about this beautiful and fun car brand.
