          The vehicles produced during the 2001 to 2006 model years included
          four hatchback models (UK and some international markets: Hatch, US:
          Hardtop, other markets just plain Mini): the standard "Mini One", the
          diesel-engined "Mini One/D", the sportier "Mini Cooper" and the
          supercharged "Mini Cooper S"; in 2005, a convertible roof option was
          added to the Mk I line-up. In November 2006, BMW released a facelift
          version of the Mini Hardtop as a 2007 model-year vehicle. <br />

          The names Cooper and Cooper S are the names used for the sportier
          version of the classic Mini, which in turn come from the involvement
          of John Cooper and the Cooper Car Company. The Cooper heritage is
          further emphasised with the John Cooper Works (JCW) range of tuning
          options. The John Cooper Works company also created a higher spec
          model of the Mini Cooper S, the Mini Cooper S Works. It has a higher
          volume exhaust and air filter, and uprated brakes and suspension, and
          different 17-inch (430 mm) wheels from the S models.

          The last Mk I variant to be produced using the supercharged Tritec
          engine was the Mini Cooper S with John Cooper Works GP Kit, a
          light-weight, quasi-race-prepped John Cooper Works model.
          Hand-finished by Bertone in Italy, it was offered as a
          limited-production run of 2000 cars during the 2006 model year, with
          444 of those originally intended for the UK market, although
          ultimately, 459 were sold. The GP has more bolstered Recaro front
          seats but had no rear seats, which along with reduced sound-deadening,
          removal of the rear wash-wipe system, optional air-conditioning and
          radio, and other weight-reduction steps, resulted in a weight saving
          of around 40 kg (88 lb) compared to a Cooper S. Mechanically, it has a
          less restrictive intercooler, recalibrated engine management,
          high-volume injector nozzles, and a freer-flowing exhaust system.
          Extra cooling capabilities let the supercharged engine run longer on
          cooler temperatures for better track performance, rated at 218 PS (215
          bhp; 160 kW) at 7100 rpm and 250 N⋅m (184 lb⋅ft)
